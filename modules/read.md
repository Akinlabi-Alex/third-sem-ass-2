# Deploy a Static Website on AWS using Terraform
Objective
Create an AWS infrastructure to host a static website using Terraform. The infrastructure will include AWS S3 for storing the website files, CloudFront for content delivery, and Route 53 for domain name management. Additional configurations will involve setting up IAM roles and policies, API Gateway, and SSL certificates.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

AWS account credentials with administrative access
Terraform installed on your local machine (Terraform Installation Guide)
Steps to Deploy
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository containing the Terraform configuration for deploying the static website infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Step 2: Configure Terraform
Initialize Terraform in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Review and modify the terraform.tfvars file if necessary to set variables like AWS region, domain name, etc.

hcl
Copy code
# Example terraform.tfvars
aws_region = "us-east-1"
domain_name = "example.com"
Step 3: Deploy Infrastructure
Apply the Terraform configuration to create the AWS infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Confirm the deployment by typing yes when prompted.

Step 4: Accessing the Website
Once Terraform completes the deployment, your static website should be accessible via the CloudFront distribution's domain name or your custom domain if configured.

Step 5: Cleaning Up
If you want to tear down the infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
Confirm the destruction by typing yes when prompted.
